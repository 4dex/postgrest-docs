## Contributing to Docs

First, thank you for helping with documentation. Great docs are
crucial for the project's success, especially because the innovative
features of PostgREST often require teaching people new ways of
building APIs.

All contributions are welcome. If you include screenshots or
illustrations in your writing please restrict them to at most 815px
wide (that's the max width of our layout), and optimize their file
size with a tool such as [Optimizilla](http://optimizilla.com).

For support during the writing process come join the project [chat
room](https://gitter.im/begriffs/postgrest).
